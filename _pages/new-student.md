<h2 id="nest">N.E.S.T. Pre-Arrival Program</h2>
If you want an early connection to UMW campus culture and activities, consider the pre-arrival program <a href="http://students.umw.edu/chls/n-e-s-t/">N.E.S.T. (New Experiences for Students Transitioning</a>).  This program spans August 20-23 and offers a unique opportunity to get a jump on exploring UMW and surrounding attractions as well as bonding with fellow students. <strong>Space is limited, and there is an associated cost.  </strong>To register or learn more, visit the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/chls/n-e-s-t/">N.E.S.T. website </a>or call (540) 654-2272.
<h2 id="movein">Move-In</h2>
New students can move into residence halls from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 22.  Returning residential students can <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/move-in/">move into their assigned residence halls </a>from 8 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on Saturday, August 26.<strong>
</strong>
<h3>Move-in Tips</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Keep your vehicle on paved areas only unless directed otherwise by UMW staff. When your vehicle is empty, move it off campus so others may move closer.</li>
 	<li>Ask the move-in crew for help carrying items – they are there to help!</li>
 	<li>It can be very warm in August. Dress appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="newstudent">New Student Arrival and Welcome</h2>
<a href="http://orientation.umw.edu/newstudentwelcome/">New Student Arrival and Welcome </a>begins on Wednesday, August 23, and encompasses several different programs to make your transition onto the UMW campus seamless.

After students and families say goodbye to one another, students will begin four days of the new student welcome experience! Our newest Eagles can expect to be introduced to the UMW campus through a variety of programs, social events, and opportunities to connect with faculty and staff. You’ll learn about what it means to be an Eagle, find out how to navigate your way on campus, get to know more about your department and, of course, have a lot of fun!

<h2 id="rise">RISE Peer Mentors</h2>
The <a href="http://students.umw.edu/multicultural/rise/">RISE Peer Mentoring Program</a> is open to incoming first-year and transfer students from underrepresented populations to assist in effectively connecting them to the Mary Washington community.  Once accepted into the program, new students (mentees) will be paired with continuing students (sophomores – seniors) as their peer mentors.

As participants in the program, students are expected to maintain weekly contact with peer mentors, participate in one group activity per month, attend at least two University-wide programs per semester, complete end-of-semester evaluations in the fall and spring, and comply with the University’s <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/facultyhandbook/section_1/diversity_inclusion/">Principles on Diversity and Inclusion</a>, <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/facultyhandbook/section_1/community_values/">Statement of Community Values</a>, <a href="http://students.umw.edu/fredericksburghonorcouncil/">Honor Code</a>, and <a href="http://students.umw.edu/judicialaffairs/the-judicial-system/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.

Any interested student may complete a <a href="http://students.umw.edu/multicultural/rise-peer-mentoring/">Peer Mentee Application Form</a>, which is available via the James Farmer Multicultural Center.  Applications for the fall semester will be accepted from May through the first week of classes in August.  There is no cost associated with this program.
