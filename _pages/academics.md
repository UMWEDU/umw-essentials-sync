<h2>Academics Questions &amp; Answers<strong>
</strong></h2>
<h3>Who is my academic advisor?</h3>
Faculty and Student Success Coordinators (SSCs) from the <a href="https://academics.umw.edu/academicservices/">Office of Academic Services</a> will assist you during your <a href="http://orientation.umw.edu/">orientation</a> session with the completion of your course schedule. Your First-Year Seminar instructor will be your academic advisor through your first year at UMW.
<h3>What courses should I think about taking as a first-year student?</h3>
Our staff will have preregistered you for a few courses based on the interests you identified in the First-Year Student Questionnaire. Beyond those courses, you should explore other electives or general education requirements to complete your schedule. The <a href="https://www.umw.edu/?search-choice=google&amp;s=new+student+guide">New Student Guide</a>, hosted on the <a href="https://academics.umw.edu/academicservices/">Academic Services website</a>, offers some advice on choosing courses. We recommend that you register for no more than 16 credits in your first semester. Keep in mind you must take a <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/fsem/">first-year seminar</a> at this time, too. The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/general-education/general-education-course-list/"><em>Undergraduate Academic Catalog</em></a> and your advisor are your best resources as you plan your course schedule.
<h3>When can I declare my major? What if I declare but change my mind later? What about minors?</h3>
New students are undeclared when they enter the University. Once a student completes his or her first year of study at UMW, he or she can declare a major. To declare a major, complete the <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/students/majorminor-declaration/">Major Declaration Form</a>. Then go to the department chair of the appropriate academic department who will assign you a major advisor. Declaring a minor is done with the same form. You can always change your mind about the major you select. In doing so, we urge you to speak with an advisor.
<h3>Iâ€™m struggling a bit. Where do I go for help?</h3>
First, you should always think of your professor as a valuable resource. Every professor has office hours during which you can ask for assistance. These hours are listed on the course syllabus. Many options for tutoring are available through the Office of Academic Services. Stop by Lee Hall for more details.

The <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/writing-fredericksburg/about-the-writing-center/">Writing Center </a>offers help with writing projects for your classes and beyond. The <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/speaking/speaking-center/">Speaking Center</a> offers help with communication skills through videotaped practice presentations and feedback, and the <a href="http://convergence.umw.edu/digital-knowledge-center/">Digital Knowledge Center </a>provides assistance with a wide range of digital projects and assignments. These centers are in the new Hurley Convergence Center, Room 429.
