<h2>Launch your first year at UMW by taking the following steps:</h2>
Request that official copies of results of Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), Cambridge, College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and dual enrollment classes, and transcripts of any college transfer credit be sent to the UMW Office of the Registrar immediately. The UMW CEEB code is 5398.

Check the Student and Financial Aid section in the Eagle Gateway Portal on <a href="https://auth.umw.edu/authenticationendpoint/login.do?commonAuthCallerPath=%252Fcas%252Flogin&amp;forceAuth=false&amp;passiveAuth=false&amp;relyingParty=Orgsync&amp;tenantDomain=carbon.super&amp;type=cassso&amp;sessionDataKey=4ff91bc1-432b-46bf-b2b3-3dc1fc36cbc6&amp;relyingParty=Orgsync&amp;type=cassso&amp;sp=default&amp;isSaaSApp=true&amp;authenticators=BasicAuthenticator:LOCAL">myUMW</a> to review your student record for any AP, IB, Cambridge, CLEP, dual enrollment, or college transfer credits that have been received and processed by the Office of the Registrar. If exam scores are missing, bring copies of the test results with you to your <a href="http://orientation.umw.edu/">June orientation</a> session. They will help during your advising meeting where you will complete the registration process. Student success coordinators and faculty will be on hand to assist you.

<strong>First-Year Students: </strong>Prior to your arrival, you completed your First-Year Student Questionnaire, which we used to enroll you in your First-Year Seminar and two additional courses. During <a href="http://orientation.umw.edu/">Orientation</a> you will work with an advisor to review those courses and add at least two more to your schedule while also learning about our general education program and how to use UMW’s online course registration system.

<strong>Transfer Students:</strong> You can register for classes beginning April 4. After paying your deposit, call Academic and Career Services at (540) 654-1010 to schedule an appointment (in person or by phone) with a Student Success Coordinator who will prepare you to register for your first semester and understand UMW degree requirements and academic expectations. You will complete your class registration during summer <a href="http://orientation.umw.edu/">orientation</a>.

<strong>TIP: </strong>Take classes that interest you! Put your alarm clock across the room so you have to get out of bed. Missing even one class can make it hard to keep up with the course work. Classes at Mary Wash are challenging. The upside is that class sizes are small, which means more chances to ask questions and get to know the professors.
