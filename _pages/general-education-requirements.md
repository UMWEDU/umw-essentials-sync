General education – taking classes in a variety of disciplines – is the foundation of a liberal arts and sciences education. The course work is designed to cultivate the skills, knowledge, and habits of mind that are essential in every field of study and that enable graduates to make effective decisions as citizens of a rapidly changing, richly diverse, and increasingly interconnected world. The requirements are designed to put the liberal arts in a contemporary context and to provide students with maximum flexibility in meeting them. For complete details, see the <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/general-education/general-education-course-list/">Undergraduate Academic Catalog</a>, available online.
