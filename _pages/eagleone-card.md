It's used for meal plans, building access, in the library, at vending machines, and more. It can be used anywhere you see an EagleOne logo.

 	<li>borrow books from <a href="http://libraries.umw.edu/">Simpson Library</a> and pay library fees</li>
 	<li>use at campus dining facilities and to check meal plan and balance information</li>
 	<li>use as a debit card with your EagleOne account</li>
 	<li>make purchases at the UMW Bookstore, Copy Center, Post Office, Health Center, Klein Theatre, University Tennis Center, and all dining operations</li>
 	<li>use in vending machines for snacks, drinks, and laundry</li>
 	<li>use for public copiers and printing at campus computer labs</li>
 	<li>make purchases from participating off-campus merchants</li>
</ul>
Funds can be added to your EagleOne account <a href="https://eagleone-sp.blackboard.com/eaccounts/AnonymousHome.aspx">24/7 online</a>, by mail, or at the Cashier’s Office and the EagleOne Card Center, both in Lee Hall. With the EagleOne card, you won’t need to carry cash, write checks, or use a bank card anywhere you see the EagleOne logo.
