<h2>Application and Agreement for Residential Students</h2>
UMW’s goal is to provide a living-learning environment that offers support, fosters academic achievement and personal development, and provides a sense of community to all its members.

New students pay a one-time $250 housing deposit as part of the Admissions’ $500 enrollment deposit, guaranteeing campus housing. Students complete their <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/housing-selection/">housing application</a> after paying their housing deposits. This <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/before-you-get-to-campus/services-agreement/">Housing and Dining Services Agreement</a> is a binding agreement between the student and the University for two full academic years (incoming first-years) or one full academic year (incoming transfer students).
