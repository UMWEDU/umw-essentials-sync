For more information regarding the topics below, and other financial aid options, please visit the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid">Office of Financial Aid</a> website. We're located in Lee Hall (second floor) and is open Monday-Friday 8am-5pm.  Please feel free to visit our office if you have questions regarding your financial aid award letter, types of available financial aid, etc. One of our representatives will be happy to chat!
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How can I access my/my student’s financial aid information?</h3>
When a student enters college, their financial aid information is considered protected information under FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act). However, a student can designate a parent or other third party to be able to access the UMW system to view the student’s financial aid award and requirement status. The sign up is available through myUMW’s Eagle Gateway. Instructions for delegated access sign-up are contained in the award letter guide that accompanied your award letter.  Without student consent, Financial Aid representatives are unable to speak to parents or other third parties regarding the student's financial aid award and requirements.
<h3>What are the costs for 2016-2017?</h3>
Current <a href="https://www.umw.edu/financialaid/process/cost-of-attendance/">estimated costs for 2016-2017</a> can be found on our Financial Aid website.
<h3>When will my bill be due for the 2016-2017 year and what other options are available?</h3>
Fall semester bills are due in late July 2016, and spring semester bills are due in November 2016. Payment plan options are available through the UMW Office of Student Accounts.
<h3>I made a mistake on my FAFSA and have updated the information. Will this change my financial aid eligibility?</h3>
Possibly. Need-based financial aid is based on the information in the FAFSA. Therefore, if the FAFSA is inaccurate, and an update is made, it can affect the amount of financial aid you receive. Keep in mind that during the FAFSA Verification process, if a Financial Aid representative finds that the FAFSA has incorrect information, they will correct that information, which could also result in a change in Financial Aid eligibility. Any time that a change is made to your financial aid package, you will be notified through your UMW email account.
<h3>What if my FAFSA does not accurately represent my family’s financial situation?</h3>
There are certain situations (divorce, death of a family member, involuntary job loss, disaster, etc.) when the FAFSA will not accurately represent a family’s financial situation. IF you feel that this is occurring, please review our UMW Special Circumstance Request Form. Students and families are encouraged to contact the Financial Aid office directly at (540)654-2468 to discuss the individual situation.
<h3>How do I accept my Federal Direct Loan offers?</h3>
There are three steps to accepting the Federal Direct Student Loans. These loans are offered to you because you completed a FAFSA. To accept, the student must log into their MyUMW portal and click “Accept Award Offer”. They must also complete <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">Direct Loan Entrance Counseling </a>and a Direct Loan MPN. Detailed <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/student-loans/application-instructions/">instructions for applying for federal loans</a> can be found on the Financial Aid website.
<h3>How do I apply for a Federal Parent Plus Loan?</h3>
Parents of dependent students can apply for this federal credit-based loan by completing the <a href="http://www.studentloans.gov">federal application</a> and all associated requirements. A <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/types/loans/parent-plus-loan/">complete list of requirements</a> can be found on the Financial Aid website. It is recommended that parents complete this process in early June.
<h3>What scholarship opportunities are available throughout the year?</h3>
Students can apply for all endowed UMW foundation scholarships and all UMW Departmental scholarships through the UMW Online Scholarship Manager. The deadline to apply for 2016-2017 scholarships was 5/1/2016. However, any other scholarships that become available throughout the year will be posted through the myUMW Financial Aid Portal. Students can sign up to become a member of the portal to receive these notifications.
<h3>Does my GPA affect my financial aid eligibility?</h3>
In accordance with federal regulations, all recipients of financial aid must maintain <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/eligibility/satisfactory-academic-progress/">Satisfactory Academic Progress</a> toward the completion of a degree and must be in good standing based on a cumulative GPA.  To maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, students must complete 70% of the credits that they attempt each semester and maintain a specific cumulative GPA based on grade level.
<h3>Can I use my financial aid to pay for books and supplies?</h3>
If the amount of your financial aid is more than your student bill for a particular semester, the UMW Bookstore Voucher process will allow you to use that overage (up to $750/semester) at the UMW Bookstore before classes begin.  Students may apply for the UMW Bookstore Voucher through the myUMW Financial Aid portal.
<h3>Can I use financial aid for the summer semester?</h3>
Eligibility for financial aid for the summer semester is based on the previous academic year. For example, if you are eligible for $5,500 for the 2016-2017 academic year, but only use $2,750, you may use the remaining $2,750 for the summer semester. Students must be enrolled in at least six credits for the summer semester to be eligible for financial aid.
<h3>What happens if a student withdraws from a semester prior to completion?</h3>
Official withdrawals from academic courses occur through the UMW Office of the Registrar. Withdrawing from all courses in a semester will affect the amount of aid that students may be eligible for during that semester. As a result, it is possible that financial aid packages may be changed after the withdrawal date is known, which could result in a balance on the student’s University account. Students that are withdrawing are encouraged to visit the Office of Financial Aid to discuss any potential consequences.
<h3>I am interested in working on campus. How do I apply?</h3>
UMW has approximately 650 on campus jobs available to students each year. Students can view and apply for open jobs through the myUMW Student Employment portal.
