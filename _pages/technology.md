As a UMW student, you’ll find that having a computer is essential to a successful academic career. See our <a href="http://technology.umw.edu/new/students/">guide for new students</a> for more information on suggested computer configurations and things to look for if you are buying a new computer.

Many technologies are available to students across UMW, including wireless Internet access, computer labs equipped with specialized software and printers, and a vast array of web resources. The state-of-the-art Hurley Convergence Center (HCC) provides multimedia production equipment for checkout, professional audio and video production workstations, a high-end video production studio with green screen capabilities, and electronic team collaboration systems for group work. Make an appointment to meet with a peer tutor in the Digital Knowledge Center to learn how to use these resources.

The web houses many resources you will use as a student, including research databases, UMWBlogs for web publishing, and the “Domain of One’s Own” initiative, where you can claim your own web domain and hosting space. <a href="https://canvas.umw.edu/">Canvas</a>, our on-line learning system, is used by many UMW faculty as an integral part of their courses. See the <a href="http://technology.umw.edu/new/">new student page</a> for details on these systems and how to get access.

Students living in residence halls have Internet and cable television services included as part of their room and board fees. ResNet, provided by Apogee, delivers wired and wireless Internet service for your computers, printer, gaming systems, and mobile devices. <a href="http://technology.umw.edu/new">Premium services</a> are available at an additional cost. You will set up your ResNet account when you move in to your residence hall.

Finally, getting technology help when you have questions is as simple as contacting the <a href="http://technology.umw.edu/helpdesk">IT Help Desk</a> at (540)654-2255 or helpdesk@umw.edu. If we can’t help you, we will do our best to direct you to the person or office that can. Info about Help Desk services, including service hours and after-hours resources, is available on the website.
<h3>You Have Questions? We Have Answers!</h3>
See the <a href="http://technology.umw.edu/new/new-student-account-setup/">New Student FAQ</a>!
<h3>Avoid Password Confusion</h3>
Students have multiple accounts and <a href="http://password.umw.edu">passwords</a> at UMW – one password works with your UMW NetID, another works with your student email, and another for residential students to access the ResNet in your residence hall.
<h3>Set Up Your Security Questions</h3>
Students are urged to set up security questions that will enable you to reset your UMW NetID password on your own. If you don’t, you’ll need to contact the Help Desk during business hours for a password reset – not convenient the night before a big exam when the Help Desk is closed.
<h3>I Need Wireless!</h3>
UMW has wireless Internet service in every building on campus. Information on how to connect and which network is best for you to use is available on the <a href="http://technology.umw.edu/new">new student page</a>.
<h3>Protect Your Account and Identity</h3>
UMW will NEVER ask you to provide Social Security numbers, passwords, or other private information via email. Phishing email tries to trick you into giving up that info. If you ever question the legitimacy of an email or information requested, contact the <a href="http://technology.umw.edu/helpdesk/">Help Desk</a>, (540) 654-2255, or forward the message to <a href="mailto:abuse@umw.edu">abuse@umw.edu</a>.
