The <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/mail/">UMW Post Office</a> is a full-service postal center. Each residential and off-campus student will be assigned a mailbox to be used for official mail from UMW and for personal mail, including packages and mail requiring a signature. They will keep the same mailbox as long as they reside on campus. Students at Eagle Landing will be assigned a box there. If they move off campus, they will be issued a new mailbox. Due to space limitations, each student shares an assigned mailbox.

Note: Except for BLS students, all residential and off-campus full-time degree-seeking undergraduate students receive official University communications and critical information in their assigned on-campus post office boxes. Official communications are also conveyed through <a href="https://auth.umw.edu/authenticationendpoint/login.do?commonAuthCallerPath=%252Fcas%252Flogin&amp;forceAuth=false&amp;passiveAuth=false&amp;relyingParty=Orgsync&amp;tenantDomain=carbon.super&amp;type=cassso&amp;sessionDataKey=4ff91bc1-432b-46bf-b2b3-3dc1fc36cbc6&amp;relyingParty=Orgsync&amp;type=cassso&amp;sp=default&amp;isSaaSApp=true&amp;authenticators=BasicAuthenticator:LOCAL">myUMW</a> and student email.
