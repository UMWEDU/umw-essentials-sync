<h2>Talley Center for Counseling Services</h2>
Good health involves more than just your body. Managing stress, attending to your emotions, developing as an individual, and building resilience all contribute to psychological well-being; an important part of staying healthy. The <a href="https://students.umw.edu/counseling/">Talley Center</a> offers brief individual therapy and group counseling to full-time degree-seeking students. Crisis intervention, consultation, educational programming, and referral services are open to the entire UMW community.

To make an appointment, call (540)654-1053 or stop by the Talley Center on the first floor of Lee Hall (Suite 106) during regular business hours. The counseling center is staffed by mental health professionals who are experienced in working with a wide array of issues that confront college students; from homesickness to social concerns to depression and anxiety. Counseling services are free and confidential.

If you have recently been or are currently in therapy:
<ul>
 	<li>Learn about the scope of our services at the <a href="https://students.umw.edu/counseling/">Talley Center</a> – the counseling center offers short-term individual therapy, group therapy, crisis intervention, and consultation services.</li>
 	<li>Develop a coping plan with your current clinician that addresses your transition to college and anticipated challenges in making the adjustment.</li>
 	<li>Talk with your clinician about warning signs of distress and helpful steps to take if your symptoms recur.</li>
 	<li>Learn about <a href="http://students.umw.edu/counseling/links-to-umw-brochures-other-resources/available-resources/">resources at UMW</a> and the Fredericksburg area; including how to access them. (Remember: First-year students may not bring cars, so please plan accordingly.)</li>
 	<li>Talk with your doctor before making any medication changes and develop a plan for medication refills. Don’t find yourself calling for a refill the day your prescription runs out!</li>
 	<li>If you anticipate needing longer-term therapy or ongoing psychiatric services, the counseling center staff can assist you in locating mental health resources in the community, including providers' insurance information and their approaches to therapy. Be sure you have your health insurance information card; many insurance plans require that you use the services from their preapproved lists of providers for the charges to be covered.</li>
