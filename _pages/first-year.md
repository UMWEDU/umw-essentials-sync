<h2>First-Year Seminar</h2>
<a href="http://academics.umw.edu/fsem/">First-year seminar</a> courses, the backbone of the <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/fye/">First-Year Experience</a> at UMW, introduce students to the pursuit of intellectual inquiry. Seminars are designed to foster interaction with outstanding faculty members while exploring nontraditional topics in nontraditional ways. One first-year seminar is required during your first semester on campus as part of UMW’s general education program. (Transfer students are not required to take a first-year seminar.) Specific topics will vary from course to course, but all promise…
<ul>
 	<li>college as you imagined it: a life of the mind taught by faculty</li>
 	<li>small classes, capped at 15 students each</li>
 	<li>active, discussion-based formats</li>
 	<li>exploration of primary texts rather than textbooks</li>
 	<li>critical examination of the class literature</li>
 	<li>development of writing and speaking skills</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Read</h2>
<span style="color: #333333"><span style="color: black">UMW has selected <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> text and accompanying soundtrack as the UMW <span id="0.6824107628560325"><span class="highlight">Common</span></span> Experience for 2018-2019 academic year.  <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> is a 2015 stage musical with a very popular soundtrack that features a high school student with social anxiety that struggles to make social connections. </span>At Orientation each new student will receive a copy of the <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/fye/common-read/">common read</a> book to read over the summer. This will serve as the foundation of a shared intellectual experience that will continue at new student arrival with Common Read discussions.</span>
