<h2>First-Year Seminar</h2>
<a href="http://academics.umw.edu/fsem/">First-year seminar</a> courses introduce students to the pursuit of intellectual inquiry. Seminars are designed to foster interaction with outstanding faculty members while exploring nontraditional topics in nontraditional ways. One first-year seminar is required during your first semester on campus as part of UMW’s general education program. (Transfer students are not required to take a first-year seminar.) Specific topics will vary from course to course, but all promise...
<ul>
 	<li>college as you imagined it: a life of the mind taught by faculty</li>
 	<li>small classes, capped at 15 students each</li>
 	<li>active, discussion-based formats</li>
 	<li>exploration of primary texts rather than textbooks</li>
 	<li>critical examination of the class literature</li>
 	<li>development of writing and speaking skills</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Reading</h2>
At Orientation each new student will receive a copy of <em>Something Must Be Done About Prince Edward County </em>to read over the summer. This will serve as the foundation of a shared intellectual experience that will continue at <a href="http://orientation.umw.edu/newstudentwelcome/">New Student Arrival</a> with Common Reading discussions.
