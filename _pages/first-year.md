<h2>First-Year Seminar</h2>
<a href="http://academics.umw.edu/fsem/">First-year seminar</a> courses, the backbone of the <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/fye/">First-Year Experience</a> at UMW, introduce students to the pursuit of intellectual inquiry. Seminars are designed to foster interaction with outstanding faculty members while exploring nontraditional topics in nontraditional ways. One first-year seminar is required during your first semester on campus as part of UMW’s general education program. (Transfer students are not required to take a first-year seminar.) Specific topics will vary from course to course, but all promise…
<ul>
 	<li>college as you imagined it: a life of the mind taught by faculty</li>
 	<li>small classes, capped at 15 students each</li>
 	<li>active, discussion-based formats</li>
 	<li>exploration of primary texts rather than textbooks</li>
 	<li>critical examination of the class literature</li>
 	<li>development of writing and speaking skills</li>
</ul>
<h2>Common Read</h2>
The Common Read Experience is a shared academic experience for students, faculty, staff, and community members the week prior to the start of classes. Previous Common Reads have focused on discussions of text, plays, and experiences. This year the Common Experience will bring in podcasts and other digital resources to discuss the extraordinary experiences we are currently living through. Details coming soon to <a href="https://academics.umw.edu/fye/common-read/">https://academics.umw.edu/fye/common-read/</a>!
