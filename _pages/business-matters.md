<h3>Banking</h3>
There is an ATM in Lee Hall operated by BB&amp;T Bank. There’s no transaction fee for BB&amp;T accounts. The fee is $2 for accounts through other banks.

There are a number of financial institutions in the vicinity of campus to meet student banking needs.
<h3>Bookstore</h3>
The <a href="http://bookstore.umw.edu/">University Bookstore</a> is owned and operated by UMW and offers an extensive inventory of everything an Eagle may need for the coming year. The bookstore has competitively priced used and new textbooks for rent or for purchase, e-books, and course packs. Use the price comparison tool on the store's site for optimal savings. For additional savings, students can participate in the textbook buyback at the end of each semester.

Wear and share your Eagle pride! The store boasts a wide selection of UMW clothing, gifts, and insignia items.

<strong>**Textbook Reservations for First-Semester Students</strong>

The Textbook Reservation Program allows you to reserve your textbooks for easy pre-semester delivery. It is offered the first semester only to incoming freshmen and transfer students. The University Bookstore will obtain your schedule, gather your books, and debit your EagleOne Account. Your books will be in your residence hall on move-in day. Beginning May 15 2017, students wishing to participate in the Textbook Reservation program can do so without physically having an EagleOne Card. An EagleOne debit account has already been established and linked to the card prior to receiving it. To take advantage of the Textbook Reservation Program, deposit $700.00 into your EagleOne account using a Visa or MasterCard through <a href="http://www.umw.edu/myumw"><u>MYUMW </u></a>or send a check (made out to UMW) with the Textbook Reservation mail in form before the deadline of July 23, 2017.
