<h3>Banking</h3>
There is an ATM in Lee Hall operated by BB&amp;T Bank. There’s no transaction fee for BB&amp;T accounts. The fee is $2 for accounts through other banks.

There are a number of financial institutions in the vicinity of campus to meet student banking needs.
<h3>Bookstore</h3>
The <a href="http://bookstore.umw.edu/">University Bookstore</a> is owned and operated by UMW and offers an extensive inventory of everything an Eagle may need for the coming year. The bookstore has competitively priced used and new textbooks, e-books, and course packs. For additional savings, students can participate in the textbook buyback at the end of each semester.

Wear and share your Eagle spirit! The store boasts a wide selection of UMW clothing, gifts, and insignia items.

<strong>**Textbook Reservations for First-Semester Students</strong>

First semester students are eligible for the added convenience of textbook reservations. With a deposit of $700 to the student’s Eagle One card, the Bookstore team will gather students’ required books based upon their schedule, and the books will be available in the residence hall for pick up on move-in day.
