<h2>Public Safety</h2>
<h3>Police - Safety and Security:</h3> The campus is protected by its own police officers, 24 hours a day all year, including holidays and breaks. The UMW PD is a full-service law enforcement agency with a range of programs from Adopt-A-Hall, which offers crime prevention tips and personal security seminars, to free licensed RAD (Rape Aggression Defense) courses. The PD also operates an on-campus safety escort in the evenings, and students may request a ride from outlying parking areas or an escort to their residence hall.

<h3>Fire Safety:</h3> UMW has fire detection and alarm systems in all buildings. Smoke detectors are in the hallways, stairwells, and rooms of residence halls. Each hall has three fire drills each semester to ensure that everyone knows how to be safe during a fire emergency. Fire safety violations such as false alarms or tampering with fire extinguishers are taken very seriously and may result in severe disciplinary action such as suspension or loss of housing privileges in addition to responsibility for the cost of damages.
<h2>Personal Safety</h2>
