<h2>Athletics</h2>
UMW is a proud member of the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about?division=d3">NCAA Division III</a> and is renowned as one of the strongest broad-based programs in the nation. Of the 23 varsity sports at UMW, 22 have competed in national championship events, and the <a href="http://www.umweagles.com/landing/index">Eagles</a> have brought home national titles in six sports. As a charter member of the <a href="http://cacsports.com/landing/index">Capital Athletic Conference (CAC)</a>, the <a href="http://www.umweagles.com/landing/index">Eagles</a> have won the CAC All-Sports Award 13 times in the 29-year history of the league. UMW also has produced hundreds of All-America selections, and countless all-region and all-conference picks.

As a DIII institution, we do not offer athletic scholarships, nor do we utilize the national letter of intent program. However, all of our sports are very competitive, and spots on the rosters are not taken for granted. Have a thorough and complete conversation with your head coach about where he or she sees you on the team. There may be an expectation of some level of tryout. All roster spots are evaluated annually, based on criteria such as academic and athletic performance, team commitment, and social responsibility. If you have any questions about where you stand or what the expectations will be, please direct them to your head coach.

All potential student-athletes must meet NCAA eligibility, complete mandatory athletic training and, NCAA forms, and register for the PHYD 400-level course corresponding to their sport. Please contact the head coach directly if you have not received instructions to complete paperwork. All forms are digital and must be completed by August 1 for the fall semester and Jan. 1 for the spring semester.
<h2>Campus Recreation and Sport Clubs</h2>
<h3>Campus Recreation:</h3>
The Department of <a href="http://students.umw.edu/campusrec">Campus Recreation</a> focuses on helping all students improve their overall wellness during their time at UMW. Physical activity is a crucial piece of wellness because it relieves stress, improves mental health and mood, is linked to better academic performance, and is a great way to socialize. Campus Recreation encourages students to find activities they enjoy that keep them moving in a variety of ways. If you’re looking for Campus Rec, stop by the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/campusrec/facilities/fitness-center/">Fitness Center</a>, located at the Eagle Village side of Campus Walk.  At the Fitness Center, you will find updated cardio and strength equipment, an Olympic training platform, a stretching area, and more.
<h3>Intramural Sports:</h3>
<a href="http://students.umw.edu/campusrec/imsports/">Intramurals </a>are a great way to stay active in sports and socialize!  Activities range from one-day tournaments to month-long sport leagues.  Sport offerings range from the traditional basketball, soccer and football to your less traditional offerings such as dodgeball and canoe battleship. There's a bit of everything for everyone at Intramural Sports. Winners of activities will receive a coveted IM Champ Shirt.
<h3>Sport Clubs:</h3>
<a href="http://students.umw.edu/campusrec/sportclubs/">Sport clubs</a> are a great way to stay active and involved in the UMW community without a large time commitment. Students compete locally, regionally, and nationally.  Clubs are student run, practice two to three times per week, and compete a minimum of three times per year.  See our website for a complete listing of sport clubs.
<h3>Outdoor Recreation:</h3>
<a href="http://students.umw.edu/campusrec/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-trips/">Outdoor Recreation</a> is the perfect way to explore surrounding Fredericksburg, and Virginia outdoors and experience fitness and wellness from a different perspective. Activities are seasonal and can range from trips such as hikes, indoor rock climbing, and caving to on-campus special events. The activities are designed to not just build an affection towards the outdoors; but to promote, preserve, inspire and create an ethos of sustainable environmental stewardship through application of Leave No Trace principles and other practices.
<h3>Fitness Programs:</h3>
Campus Recreation offers over 30 group fitness classes each week, including Zumba, Yoga, Cycle, Cardio Kickboxing, Barre, Strength, and more. Students have the opportunity to purchase an annual fitness pass that grants access to every class on the group fitness schedule, which changes each semester. If you’re looking for a more individualized fitness experience, personal training is also available at an affordable rate.

Student Employees Welcome!

<h4>Love community service?</h4>
In the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/coar/">Community Outreach and Resources office, (COAR),</a> students organize service opportunities for students. COAR has nearly 20 weekly ongoing programs that include tutoring and mentoring children and teens, building with Habitat for Humanity, spending time with the elderly and animals, and working on environmental projects. COAR also sponsors on-campus service programs for the community such as a trick-or-treat in the fall and an egg hunt in the spring. Whether volunteering on your own or with a group, COAR is a great place to start!
