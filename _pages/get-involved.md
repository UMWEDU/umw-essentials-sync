<h2>Athletics</h2>
UMW is a proud member of the <a href="http://www.ncaa.org/about?division=d3">NCAA Division III</a> and is renowned as one of the strongest broad-based programs in the nation. Of the 23 sports at UMW, 20 have competed in national championship events, and the <a href="http://www.umweagles.com/landing/index">Eagles</a> have brought home national titles in five sports. As a charter member of the <a href="http://cacsports.com/landing/index">Capital Athletic Conference (CAC)</a>, the <a href="http://www.umweagles.com/landing/index">Eagles</a> have won the CAC All-Sports Award 12 times in the 26-year history of the league. UMW also has produced hundreds of All-America selections, and countless all-region and all-conference picks.

As a DIII institution, we do not offer athletic scholarships, nor do we utilize the national letter of intent program. However, all of our sports are very competitive, and spots on the rosters are not taken for granted. Have a thorough and complete conversation with your head coach about where he or she sees you on the team. There may be an expectation of some level of tryout. All roster spots are evaluated annually, based on criteria such as academic and athletic performance, team commitment, and social responsibility. If you have any questions about where you stand or what the expectations will be, please direct them to your head coach.

All potential student-athletes must meet NCAA eligibility, complete mandatory athletic training and, NCAA forms, and register for the PHYD 400-level course corresponding to their sport. Please contact the head coach directly if you have not received instructions to complete paperwork. All forms are digital and must be completed by Jan. 1, 2017.
<h2>Campus Recreation and Sport Clubs</h2>
<h3>Campus Recreation:</h3>
The Department of <a href="http://students.umw.edu/campusrec">Campus Recreation</a> focuses on helping all students improve their overall wellness during their time at UMW. Physical activity is a crucial piece of wellness because it relieves stress, improves mental health and mood, is linked to better academic performance, and is a great way to socialize. Campus Recreation encourages students to find activities they enjoy that keep them moving in a variety of ways. If you're looking for Campus Rec, Stop by the  <a href="http://students.umw.edu/campusrec/facilities/fitness-center/">Fitness Center</a>, located at the Eagle Village side of Campus Walk.  At the Fitness Center, you will find updated cardio and strength equipment, an Olympic training platform, a  stretching area, and more.

<h2>Center for Honor, Leadership, and Service</h2>
<h4>Turn your passion into action!</h4>
Mary Washington is a special place, one marked by mutual trust, respect, and engagement with our community. Our words, actions, and relationships affect others, regardless of our roles or the positions we hold. At the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/chls/n-e-s-t/">Center for Honor, Leadership, and Service (CHLS)</a>, we nurture our culture through community service, honorable behavior, and leadership development. <em>The staff and students of CHLS are committed to helping everyone at UMW be the change they wish to see in the world and turn their passion into action.</em>
<h4>Love community service?</h4>
In the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/coar/">Community Outreach and Resources office, (COAR),</a> students organize service opportunities for students. COAR has nearly 20 weekly ongoing programs that include tutoring and mentoring children and teens, building with Habitat for Humanity, spending time with the elderly and animals, and working on environmental projects. COAR also sponsors on-campus service programs for the community such as a trick-or-treat in the fall and an egg hunt in the spring. Whether volunteering on your own or with a group, COAR is a great place to start!
<h4>Horizons</h4>
<a href="http://students.umw.edu/chls/welcome-2/horizons/">Horizons</a> is a year-long program that offers students the opportunity to engage, learn, and grow at UMW.  Grounded in the core values of honor, leadership, and service, students in <a href="http://students.umw.edu/chls/welcome-2/horizons/">Horizons</a> are active on campus and in our community, learn about themselves, reflect on their own goals and values, and grow as leaders and citizens.  Through innovative practices, students are challenged to connect a liberal arts education to “real world” skills, learning lessons that will benefit them for the rest of their lives.
<h2>Clubs and Organizations</h2>
Be the president of your own club – it’s easy to start a special interest group. Or, be an officer or member of an established club – they’re open to all interested students. Club members develop leadership, organizational, and interpersonal skills that can translate into experiences that can be listed on your future resume. Visit <a href="http://students.umw.edu/studentactivities/">Student Activities and Engagement</a> in the University Center, 3<sup>rd</sup> floor.
<h2>Concerts!  Movies!  Traditions!</h2>
<a href="http://students.umw.edu/studentactivities/">Student Activities and Engagement (SAE)</a> is the place to go if you want to get involved on campus. More than 120 different organizations create events – from weekly bingo to major concerts. Want to apply some of those things you learn in the classroom? Join one of our multiple academic-based clubs!
