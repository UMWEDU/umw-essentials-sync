<h2>Office of Disability Resources</h2>
<span style="color: #000000;font-family: Times New Roman">The Office of Disability Resources (ODR) coordinates reasonable and appropriate accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. These accommodations are based on individual student profiles and may include – but are not limited to – extended time on tests, note-taking assistance, accessible dorm rooms, sign language interpreters, electronic texts, and distraction-reduced testing sites.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;font-family: Times New Roman">In order to receive services, students must provide professional documentation of a substantially limiting condition and discuss appropriate accommodations with the ODR. Documentation guidelines for specific disabilities may be found on the </span><a href="http://academics.umw.edu/disability/">Disability Resources web site</a><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Times New Roman"> or by requesting it from the office at 540/654-1266.  The ODR verifies the disability, determines reasonable accommodations in collaboration with the student, and acts as a liaison with students, faculty, and administration as needed on issues relating to services or accommodations.</span>
