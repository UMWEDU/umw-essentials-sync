<h2>Dining Q&amp;A</h2>
<h3>How do I choose a meal plan?</h3>
Campus Dining offers a variety of meal plans tailored to fit the appetite and dining preferences of any residential or commuter student. Visit the <a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/">Campus Dining</a> website, for details about current plans.
<h3>How do I purchase or change a meal plan?</h3>
Resident students choose and pay for meal plans when making a housing selection. Commuting students select their meal plans separately. Changes to meal plans can only be made during the first two weeks of the semester. All purchases and changes are made through the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/residencelife/on-campus/housing-procedures/meal-plan-information/">Residence Life</a> website.
<h3>What Do Meal Plans Include?</h3>
Meal plans include a <a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/my-meal-plan">set number of meals and Flex Dollars</a>. A meal is equal to one entry to the buffets at the top of the University Center. If you have unused meals at the end of the semester they don’t roll over to the next semester.
<h3>What are Flex Dollars?</h3>
Flex is a cash equivalent debit account that comes with your meal plan. You can use Flex Dollars to make food purchases at all campus dining locations. Unused Flex Dollars roll over from the fall to the spring semester as long as you still have a meal plan.

Flex balances left at the end of the spring semester are forfeited.
<h3>What’s Resident &amp; Retail Dining?</h3>
The resident dining buffets at the <a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/dining-near-me/top-of-the-uc">Top of the UC</a> are an all-you-care-to-eat restaurant. For each visit you are charged one meal which allows you to get as much food as you wish during that visit. Retail dining locations like Qdoba sell items individually. You may pay for those items with Flex Dollars, EagleOne dollars, cash, or credit. Retail locations also offer <strong>Meal Deals</strong> that allow you to use meals and Flex Dollars for special food combos. Meal Deals are available at all retail dining locations except the Eatz on the Street Food Truck. *<em>Note: Students on the Eagle dining plan may use up to 30 meals per semester for Meal Deals at retail locations.</em>
<h3>What are EagleOne dollars?</h3>
Your <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/eagleone/">EagleOne card</a> is your admission ticket to the dining facilities. You can purchase EagleOne dollars at the EagleOne ID Center, the Office of Student Accounts, by mail, or online at <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/eagleone/">adminfinance.umw.edu/eagleone</a>. EagleOne dollars may be used at all campus dining locations and at numerous off-campus businesses. Purchases made with EagleOne dollars are subject to Virginia sales tax. Unused EagleOne dollars will remain in your account for the duration of your enrollment.
<h3>What’s on the menu?</h3>
To check menus, visit UMW Dining at umwdining.com, follow us on Twitter (@umwdining) or “like” <a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/">UMW Dining</a> on Facebook (UMWdining).
<h3>Special diet?</h3>
Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free items, as well as allergen-free plates at Simple Servings, are available at all meal periods in Resident Dining at the Top of the University Center. Some special dietary items are also offered at Simply To Go and Naturally Woodstock. If you are on a restricted diet, contact the general manager at 540/654-2230 for assistance.
<h3>May I bring a guest for dinner?</h3>
Yes! All meal plans allow students to use five of their plan meals as guest meals. You may also purchase meals at any dining facility with Flex Dollars, EagleOne, cash or credit.
<h2>Where to eat on campus</h2>
<h3>The University Center</h3>
<h4><a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/dining-near-me/top-of-the-uc">Resident Dining </a>- Top of the University Center</h4>
The entire fourth floor of the University Center is dedicated to resident dining’s all-you-care-to-eat buffets offered at nine specialty serving areas. You can start each day with a full hot breakfast served weekdays from 7 a.m. until 11 a.m. Enjoy mouth-watering pastries baked before your eyes at the Magic Oven, or make your own Belgian waffle at “Graze” – our fruit, breads, and spreads bar.

For lunch and dinner, we offer a variety of selections designed to meet almost every dining preference or diet plan. You’ll find traditional home-style classics (like meatloaf, roast chicken, and mashed potatoes); Italian pastas and pizzas; hamburgers and other grilled sandwiches; deli sandwiches made to order; and international dishes like chicken and broccoli stir-fry or Greek gyros. We’re also pleased to offer hot vegan dishes at the Sustenance Vegan Grill, and complete allergen-free (no gluten, milk, eggs, nuts, soy, wheat, or shellfish) plates at Simple Servings. The new gluten-free serving area added at the back side of the Sustenance Station, “Grains &amp; Grub,” will offer a variety of proteins and grains for lunch and dinner. Gluten-free breakfast items will also be served in this area. These gluten-free options will be in addition to the ones offered daily for lunch and dinner at Simple Servings. Don’t forget dessert! You can choose our house-made gelato, fresh-baked cookies and cakes, or a soft-serve ice cream cone to put a sweet ending to your bountiful meal.
